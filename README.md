# BitPredict: Bitcoin Price Prediction Model

Welcome to **BitPredict**, a real-time Bitcoin price prediction model that leverages machine learning to provide accurate and up-to-date predictions. This repository contains the code for a Streamlit web application that fetches real-time Bitcoin price data, processes it, and predicts future prices.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Fetching**: Fetches real-time Bitcoin price data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model to predict future Bitcoin prices.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Displays historical price trends and prediction accuracy using Plotly.
- **Future Predictions**: Provides price predictions for the next 30 days.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive Streamlit dashboard for easy use.

## Project Structure
- app.py: Main Streamlit application script.
- requirements.txt: Python dependencies required for the project.

## Usage
- Bitcoin Price Data: View real-time Bitcoin price data fetched from Yahoo Finance.
- Bitcoin Trend Chart: Visualize historical price trends.
- Prediction Accuracy Chart: Compare predicted prices with actual prices.
- Next 1 Month Price Prediction: View predicted prices for the next 30 days.
- Next 10 Days Predicted Prices: View a table of predicted prices for the next 10 days.

## Model Details
- The model is trained using historical Bitcoin price data.
- It uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks for time series prediction.
- The training data includes Bitcoin prices from January 2015 to the present day minus one day.
- The model evaluates performance using metrics like MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), WMAPE (Weighted MAPE), and sMAPE (Symmetric MAPE).
